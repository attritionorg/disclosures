Various problems in AtEase
--

(at ease is 3rd party program)



Subject: Re: Hacking Macintrash - At Ease

At ease is my nemesis, and I've copme up with a couple creative methods.

1. Install any software that requires that "it cannot be installed while
apps other than the finder are running, then Force Quit
(ctrl-command-option-esc) in the middle of the install.  I've actually
tried resediting an installer script to just drop you out without the risk
of a force-quit, but it never really worked.

or

2. Get Cassady and Greene's conflict catcher.  Use the installer to stick
it on the hard drive, then use Resedit and the CC control panel to make it
look like it's not there (make the panel invisible), but leave yourself a
startup hotkey that disables the At Ease Startup Extension.

or

Make a boot floppy.  If you want the original Admin password to remain
intact, go into system folder:prefernces, and get the At Ease prefernces
file.  Kepp it on a disk, but delete it from the HD, when you restart,
there will be NO admin password, but you can still recopy the file to leve
the machine looking unhacked.

OR

Some apps are notorious for overriding At Ease's lockout functions (I
believe Resedit and Apple File Exchange work well on Versions previous to
At Ease 2.0.7)

Have Fun
Yeah it's played, but nothing suits me better:
No matter what the world knows about you, to thine own self be true.

Put in a System CD-ROM and press CMD-OPT-SHIFT-BACKSPACe to avoid booting on
the internal HD


I have been compiling At Ease hacking info for a few months now, and I've
got some good ones. At login, where you're supposed to enter your pw,
press command-p a couple dozen times. Then just don't type anything and
press return; about 50% of the time it works anyway. Also, the best thing
for hacking At Ease is DisEase 3.0, by MacPants. It's hard to find, so
mail me at Ryder@sisna.com if you want it.


I.  If the computer is running system 7.5, hold down <space bar> on startup.
    The Extention Manager will come up.  Uncheck At Ease Startup.
    Let it continue to boot.  Then Reboot.  It will boot without At Ease.

II. Get hold of system 7.5 utilities disk (only 7.5 because it's garunteed
    to work on all system).  Put DisEase on it (I can trade you that for
    something else).  Boot the machine with the disk holding down
    <shift> + <option> + <command> + <delete> (to disable the hard drive.)
    Run DisEase to get any passwords needed.  Reboot and just use the pass-
    words so nothing get messed up on the system and the admin won't know
    you were there.


**Well, it's pretty easy. The old network at my school used to use 
Mac Classics.

Look on the left hand side of the case. There will be two
buttons. The one closest to you is 'reset'. The seocond one is the
programmers box. Hit it.

Now, if you are in At Ease, just type 'G FINDER', exactly. It
will exit whatever shell it is in and hop to the finder. While there do
whatever you want. I suggest thrashing some system files and then
slapping on a keygrabber. When the netadmin comes to fix it you can just
get the password and use on the other computers which will most likely
have the same passwd.**
