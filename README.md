# Occasional Vulnerability Disclosures

Occasionally I run into mostly trivial vulnerabilities and don't have the time to do proper write-ups. However, sometimes it is better to just get something published than nothing at all. 

As of 2023-11-19, these are all likely to be the result of watching web server logs and seeing active exploitation. Essentially zero-days of sorts, but they invariably appear in plenty of published web server logs. Difference is, they stay buried there until someone calls them out and publishes.
